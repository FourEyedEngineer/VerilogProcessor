# VerilogProcessor

This is a five stage processor that is not pipelined.

The task when creating this processor was to create a wroking Verilog ARM datapath, including all the components necessary to complete instructions (Loads, Stores, R-Type, I-Type, Branches). Given a starting PC, it should be able to load the instructions from instruction memory, decode, execute, and save.
